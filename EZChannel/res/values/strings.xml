		Playlist ID of the YouTube user. This must be provided for an app based on EZChannel.
    	To get the playlist ID of a YouTube user, go to https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/channels/list. In the "Try it!" section,
    	enter "contentDetails" for the "part" field and enter a user name for the "forUsername" field. In the response, you can find the ID of
    	the "uploads" channel of this user. 
		For example, the response is something like:
     		"contentDetails": {
	 			"relatedPlaylists": {
     				"likes": "LL4zccsgn1Nys_sIcOYd2fTw",
     				"uploads": "UU4zccsgn1Nys_sIcOYd2fTw"
     			},
     			"googlePlusUserId": "113813076890051346066"
	 		}
		Here "uploads":"UU4zccsgn1Nys_sIcOYd2fTw" is what you need to put here.
